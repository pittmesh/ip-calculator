======================

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/pittmesh/ip-calculator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pittmesh/ip-calculator)

This calculator takes a MAC address and calculates the appropriate mesh-facing IP address and WLAN-facing address in the same way that [commotiond](https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotiond) does. See [the verification ticket](https://github.com/pittmesh/ip-calculator/issues/1) for more information and links to where commotiond does it thing.
